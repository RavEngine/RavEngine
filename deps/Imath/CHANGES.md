## Version 3.1.12 (September 9, 2024)

Patch release with a small fix:

* Support for compiling half.h with hip-runtime-amd

Also, the v3.1.11 release had improper versioning in its cmake and

via [sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev).

## Version 3.1.10 (January 26, 2024)

Patch release with various build/bug fixes.

Build fixes:

  - Fix a problem where downstream projects using Imath would build
    python bindings even if they weren't requested.
  - Fix for missing `std::bit_cast`
  - Fix missing/necessary use of IMATH_HOSTDEVICE 
  - IMATH_INSTALL_PKG_CONFIG is now on by default, even on Windows 
  - Fix calling default constructor by uniform init in TypeTraits
  - Fix redundant PYIMATH_EXPORTS causing compile issues on Windows Clang 
  - Update to SO versioning policy: 

    This change adopts a policy of appending the ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``
    software release name to the ``SONAME`` to form the real name of the
    shared library.

    See [website/install.rst](website/install.rst) and [PR
    #339](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/339)
    for more details.

Bug fixes:

  - Fix half to float giving wrong results on older x86_64 CPUs on Windows 

Other changes:

  - succ()/pred() now use std::nextafter(). 
  - Expand epsilon bounds for m44x pyImath test. 
  - Rename "docs" to "website". 
  - Add missing copyright/license identifiers.

## Version 3.1.9 (May 31, 2023)

Patch release that fixes an correct .so version number introduced in
v3.1.8. All Imath library functionality is compatible with v3.1.8.

This release also reverts
[#305](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath/pull/305),
which inadvertently introduced additional python bindings in v3.1.8
that altered the ABI of ``libPyImath``. ``libPyImath`` is now
ABI-compatible with v3.1.7 and previous releases.

## Version 3.1.8 (May 22, 2023)

**NOTE: this version has an incorrect .so number and should not be used. Use v3.1.9 instead.**

Patch release that addresses miscellaneous minor compiler/build/doc
issues and extends test coverage.

## Version 3.1.1 (July 20, 2021)

* \[[#184](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath/pull/184)\] Include ``<x86intrin.h>`` only if ``__x86_64__``

## Version 3.1.0 (July 13, 2021)

Minor release with new features:

* Optimized half-to-float and float-to-half conversion, using F16C SSE
  instruction set if available. Non-SSE conversion eliminates the
  float-to-half exponent lookup table, and half-to-float conversion
  provides a compile-time-optional bit shifting that is slower but
  eliminates the need for the lookup table, for applications where
  memory is limited.

  Half-to-float and float-to-half conversion is also available as
  C-language functions ``imath_half_to_float()`` and
  ``imath_float_to_half()``.
  
  All new conversions produced identical results, and new options are
  off by default to ensure backwards compatibility. See
  https://imath.readthedocs.io for more info.
  
* ``noexcept`` specifier can be eliminated at compile-time via the
  ``IMATH_USE_NOEXCEPT`` CMake option.

* Python bindings:
  * FixedArray objects support a "read only" state.
  * FixedArray objects support python buffer protocol.

* Optimized 4x4 matrix multiplication.

## Version 3.0.1 (April 1, 2021)

First release of Imath independent of OpenEXR.

See the [porting guide](docs/PortingGuide2-3.md) for details about
differences from previous releases.

Summary:

* Imath includes the half type, formerly in a separate Half library.
* Headers are installed in ``Imath/`` subdirectory.
* All appropriate methods are marked constexpr, noexcept
* Appropriate declaration include CUDA ``__host__`` and ``__device__``
  directives.
* Throwing methods throw std exceptions instead of ``Iex``.
* New Vec and Matrix interoperability constructors for conversion from
  other similar type objects.
* Symbol linkage visibility is limited to specific public symbols.
* python bindings are off by default, available by setting ``PYTHON=ON``.
* Deprecated features:
  - ``std::numeric_limits`` replaces ``Imath::limits``.
  - ``Int64`` and ``SInt64`` are deprecated in favor of ``uint64_t``
    and ``int64_t``.

## Version 3.0.1-beta (March 28, 2021)

Beta patch release:

* \[[#131](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath/pull/131)\] #if IMATH_FOREIGN_VECTOR_INTEROP around type detectors

* \[[#130](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath/pull/130)\] Forward declarations only if header is not included

## Version 3.0.0-beta (March 15, 2021)

First release of Imath independent of OpenEXR.

See the [porting guide](docs/PortingGuide2-3.md) for details about
differences from previous releases.

Summary and Key Changes:

* Imath includes the half type, formerly in a separate Half library.
* Headers are installed in ``Imath/`` subdirectory.
* Header files have been pruned of extraneous ``#include``'s, which may
  require updates to application source code.
* All appropriate methods are marked constexpr, noexcept
* Appropriate declaration include CUDA ``__host__`` and ``__device__``
  directives.
* Throwing methods throw std exceptions instead of ``Iex``.
* New Vec and Matrix interoperability constructors for conversion from
  other similar type objects.
* Symbol linkage visibility is limited to specific public symbols.
* Python bindings are off by default, available by setting ``PYTHON=ON``.
* Deprecated features:
  - ``std::numeric_limits`` replaces ``Imath::limits``.
