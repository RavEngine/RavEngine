Imath is a basic, light-weight, and efficient C++ representation of 2D
and 3D vectors, 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 matrices, and other simple but useful
mathematical objects, functions, and data types common in computer
graphics applications, including the :doc:`classes/half` 16-bit floating-point
type.

Imath also includes optional python bindings for all types and
functions, including optimized implementations of vector and matrix
arrays.

Imath is maintained by the `OpenEXR project <https://openexr.com>`_, a part of the `Academy
Software Foundation <https://www.aswf.io>`_.
