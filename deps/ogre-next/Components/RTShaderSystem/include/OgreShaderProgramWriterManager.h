    implementation is in a .h file, which means it gets compiled
    into anybody who includes it. This is needed for the
    Singleton template to work, but we actually only want it
    compiled into the implementation of the class based on the
    Singleton, not all of them. If we don't change this, we get
    link errors when trying to use the Singleton-based class from
    an outside dll.
    @par
    This method just delegates to the template version anyway,
    but the implementation stays in this single compilation unit,
    preventing link errors.
