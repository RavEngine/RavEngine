        @param params
            * fresnel <value [g, b]>
                The IOR. @See setIndexOfRefraction
                When specifying three values, the fresnel is separate for each
                colour component

            * fresnel_coeff <value [g, b]>
                Directly sets the fresnel values, instead of using IORs
                "F0" in most books about PBS

            * roughness <value>
                Specifies the roughness value. Should be in range (0; inf)
                Note: Values extremely close to zero could cause NaNs and
                INFs in the pixel shader, also depends on the GPU's precision.

            * diffuse <r g b>
                Specifies the RGB diffuse colour. "kD" in most books about PBS
                Default: diffuse 1 1 1 1
                Note: Internally the diffuse colour is divided by PI.

            * diffuse_map <texture name>
                Name of the diffuse texture for the base image (optional)

            * specular <r g b>
                Specifies the RGB specular colour. "kS" in most books about PBS
                Default: specular 1 1 1 1

            * specular_map <texture name>
                Name of the specular texture for the base image (optional).

            * roughness_map <texture name>
                Name of the roughness texture for the base image (optional)
                Note: Only the Red channel will be used, and the texture will be converted to
                an efficient monochrome representation.

            * normal_map <texture name>
                Name of the normal texture for the base image (optional) for normal mapping

            * detail_weight_map <texture name>
                Texture that when present, will be used as mask/weight for the 4 detail maps.
                The R channel is used for detail map #0; the G for detail map #1, B for #2,
                and Alpha for #3.
                This affects both the diffuse and normal-mapped detail maps.

            * detail_map0 <texture name>
              Similar: detail_map1, detail_map2, detail_map3
                Name of the detail map to be used on top of the diffuse colour.
                There can be gaps (i.e. set detail maps 0 and 2 but not 1)

            * detail_blend_mode0 <blend_mode>
              Similar: detail_blend_mode1, detail_blend_mode2, detail_blend_mode3
                Blend mode to use for each detail map. Valid values are:
                    "NormalNonPremul", "NormalPremul", "Add", "Subtract", "Multiply",
                    "Multiply2x", "Screen", "Overlay", "Lighten", "Darken",
                    "GrainExtract", "GrainMerge", "Difference"

            * detail_offset_scale0 <offset_u> <offset_v> <scale_u> <scale_v>
              Similar: detail_offset_scale1, detail_offset_scale2, detail_offset_scale3
                Sets the UV offset and scale of the detail maps.

            * detail_normal_map0 <texture name>
              Similar: detail_normal_map1, detail_normal_map2, detail_normal_map3
                Name of the detail map's normal map to be used.
                It's not affected by blend mode. May be used even if
                there is no detail_map

            * detail_normal_offset_scale0 <offset_u> <offset_v> <scale_u> <scale_v>
              Similar: detail_normal_offset_scale1, detail_normal_offset_scale2,
                       detail_normal_offset_scale3
                Sets the UV offset and scale of the detail normal maps.

            * reflection_map <texture name>
                Name of the reflection map. Must be a cubemap. Doesn't use an UV set because
                the tex. coords are automatically calculated.

            * uv_diffuse_map <uv>
              Similar: uv_specular_map, uv_normal_map, uv_detail_mapN, uv_detail_normal_mapN,
                       uv_detail_weight_map
              where N is a number between 0 and 3.
                UV set to use for the particular texture map.
                The UV value must be in range [0; 8)
