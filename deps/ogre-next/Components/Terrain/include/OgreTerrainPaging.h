    /** This class is the 'core' class for paging terrain, that will integrate
        with the larger paging system and provide the appropriate utility
        classes required. 
    @remarks
        You should construct this class after PageManager and before any PagedWorlds
        that might use it are created / loaded. Once constructed, it will make
        the "Terrain" PagedWorldSection type available, which uses a grid strategy for
        paging and uses TerrainGroup for the content. Other content can 
        be embedded in the pages too but the terrain is done like this in order
        to maintain connections between pages and other global data.
    @par
        Because PagedWorld and all attached classes have to be loadable from a stream, 
        most of the functionality is provided behind generalised interfaces. However,
        for constructing a paged terrain in code you can use utility methods on 
        this class. This procedurally created data can then be saved in a generic 
        form which will reconstruct on loading. Alternatively you can use the 
        generic methods and simply cast based on your prior knowledge of the types
        (or checking the type names exposed).

        /** Create a TerrainPagedWorldSection.
        @remarks
            This is the simplest way to create a world section which is configured
            to contain terrain (among other objects if you want). You can also do this
            by calling PagedWorld::createSection with the type "Terrain" but there
            are more steps to configuring it that way (note: this is how loading 
            works though so it remains generic).
        @param world The PagedWorld that is to contain this section
        @param terrainGroup A TerrainGroup which must have been pre-configured before
            this call, to at least set the origin, the world size, and the file name
            convention.
        @param loadRadius The radius from the camera at which terrain pages will be loaded
        @param holdRadius The radius from the camera at which terrain pages will be held in memory
            but not loaded if they're not already. This must be larger than loadRadius and is used
            to minimise thrashing if the camera goes backwards and forwards at the loading border.
        @param minX,minY,maxX,maxY The min/max page indexes that the world will try to load pages for, 
            as measured from the origin page at (0,0) by a signed index. The default is -10 to 10
            in each direction or 20x20 pages.
        @param sectionName An optional name to give the section (if none is
            provided, one will be generated)
        @param loadingIntervalMs An optional interval in milliseconds to wait between loading single
            pages. The default is 900 ms.
        @return The world section which is already attached to and owned by the world you passed in. 
            There is no 'destroy' method because you destroy via the PagedWorld, this is just a
            helper function.
