    /** Helper class to assist you in managing multiple terrain instances
        that are connected to each other. 
    @remarks
        This class makes it easy to specify the same options for a group of
        terrain instances and have them positioned relative to each other and
        associated via each other's neighbour connections. You can do all this
        manually but this class just makes things easier, so that you only 
        have to specify most options once. 
    @par
        Terrains are maintained in a grid of entries, and for simplicity
        the grid cells are indexed from 0 as a 'centre' slot, supporting both 
        positive and negative values. so (0,0) is the centre slot, (1,0) is the
        slot to the right of the centre, (1,0) is the slot above the centre, (-2,1) 
        is the slot two to the left of the centre and one up, etc. The maximum
        extent of each axis is -32768 to +32767, so in other words enough for
        over 4 billion entries. That should be enough for anyone!
    @par
        Note that this is not a 'paging' class as such. It's simply a way to make it easier to 
        perform common tasks with multiple terrain instances, which you choose when 
        to define, load and remove. Automatic paging is handled separately by the Paging
        component.

            All neighbouring terrains should have the same basic settings (particularly
            the size parameters) - to avoid having to set the terrain import information 
            more than once, you can retrieve the standard settings for this group

            using these base settings (plus any per-instance settings you might
            want to use). 
        @note 
            The structure returned from this method is intended for in-place modification, 
            that's why it is not const and there is no equivalent 'set' method.
            You should not, however, change the alignment or any of the size parameters 
            after you start constructing instances, since neighbouring terrains
            should have the same size & alignment.
