OGRE MINGW PRECOMPILED SDK
==============================

The Ogre samples are only included as source code. To compile them, you
need CMake which you can get at: http://www.cmake.org
Install CMake, then edit the file BuildSamples.bat. Change the line 
beginning with CMAKE=... to point to your CMake installation directory.
Change the line beginning with MINGW=... to point to your MinGW installation.
If you want, you can select a build type by changing the line BUILD=...
to one of Release, Debug and RelWithDebInfo (case-sensitive!).

Save BuildSamples.bat, then run it. If everything is set up correctly,
this should now build the Samples.
