        notifications of RenderTarget events.
        @remarks
            A 'listener' is an interface designed to be called back when
            particular events are called. This class defines the
            interface relating to RenderTarget events. In order to receive
            notifications of RenderTarget events, you should create a subclass of
            RenderTargetListener and override the methods for which you would like
            to customise the resulting processing. You should then call
            RenderTarget::addListener passing an instance of this class.
            There is no limit to the number of RenderTarget listeners you can register,
            allowing you to register multiple listeners for different purposes.

            RenderTarget events occur before and after the target is updated as a whole,
            and before and after each viewport on that target is updated. Each RenderTarget
            holds it's own set of listeners, but you can register the same listener on
            multiple render targets if you like since the event contains details of the
            originating RenderTarget.

        Note that this could have been an abstract class, but I made

        people the option of only implementing the methods they wanted,
        rather than having to create 'do nothing' implementations for
        those they weren't interested in. As such this class follows
        the 'Adapter' classes in Java rather than pure interfaces.
