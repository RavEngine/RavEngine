        properties like the material they use, the plane they lie on.
        @remarks
            Whilst for discrete geometry (i.e. movable objects) groups of faces are
            held in the SubMesh class, for immovable objects like scenery there
            needs to ba little more flexibility in the grouping since the group is
            likely to be a small part of a huge set of geometry. In addition, because
            the faces are unmoving certain optimisations can be performed, e.g.
            precalculating a world-coordinate bounding box and normal.
        @par
            Exactly how this class is used depends on the format of the large
            static geometry used in the level. An example would be the use of this
            class in the BspNode class for indoor levels.
            For flexibility and efficiency, it is not assumed that this class holds
            details of the vertices itself, or in fact that it holds the vertex indices
            itself. Everything is manipulated via pointers so if you want this
            class to point into a block of geometry data it can.
