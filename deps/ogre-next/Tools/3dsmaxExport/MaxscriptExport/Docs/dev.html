Just a few words which could help to know how the script works:

<H3> EXPORTING MESHES: </H3>

<H4> Vertices and TVertices:</H4>

Vertices describes where faces are and tvertices how faces will be mapped.
<U>There is no link between their numbers in 3dsmax.</U>
But as it is said in the Maxscript Reference there are as many face as TVface. <BR>
In order to retrieve information, getFace() and getTVFace() link vertices and tvertices.
<BR>
This is the same problem with colour vertices ( function is caled getVCFace() ).

<H4> Bone assignements: </H4>

Skinops provides lots of functions in order to deal with bone assignement.
So the mesh MUST have a Skin modifier.<BR>

<B>NOTA</B>: In order to increase speed when this skeleton is used with OGRE, if a weight is < 0.1, there will not be a bone assignement.


<H3>EXPORTING SKELETONS</H3>

<H4>Key controllers:</H4>

Script reads controllers of bones which are in skeleton, in order to knwo when it should set a keyframe.<BR>

<H4>Position and rotation in XML file</H4>

Bones position always refers to parent coordinates. Initial rotation must be set in parent coordinates too.<BR>
But then, in tracks, rotation and position are relative to their first value. (Hmmm, sorry I don't find the words to explain that...)

<H3>OTHERS</H3>

<H4>3ds max objects name</H4>

Caution: When a name is "Left Arm", the name to select this object is Left_Arm.
So there is a function in usefulfns.ms which does replacement.
