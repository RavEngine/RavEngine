# - This module looks for Doxygen and the path to Graphviz's dot
# Doxygen is a documentation generation tool.  Please see
# http://www.doxygen.org
#
# This module accepts the following optional variables:
#
#   DOXYGEN_SKIP_DOT       = If true this module will skip trying to find Dot
#                            (an optional component often used by Doxygen)
#
# This modules defines the following variables:
#
#   DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE     = The path to the doxygen command.
#   DOXYGEN_FOUND          = Was Doxygen found or not?
#
#   DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE = The path to the dot program used by doxygen.
#   DOXYGEN_DOT_FOUND      = Was Dot found or not?
#   DOXYGEN_DOT_PATH       = The path to dot not including the executable

# ===== Rationale for OS X AppBundle mods below =====
#     With the OS X GUI version, Doxygen likes to be installed to /Applications and
#     it contains the doxygen executable in the bundle. In the versions I've 
#     seen, it is located in Resources, but in general, more often binaries are 
#     located in MacOS.
#
#     NOTE: The official Doxygen.app that is distributed for OS X uses non-standard 
#     conventions.  Instead of the command-line "doxygen" tool being placed in
#     Doxygen.app/Contents/MacOS, "Doxywizard" is placed there instead and 
#     "doxygen" is placed in Contents/Resources.  This is most likely done
#     so that something happens when people double-click on the Doxygen.app
#     package.  Unfortunately, CMake gets confused by this as when it sees the
#     bundle it uses "Doxywizard" as the executable to use instead of
#     "doxygen".  Therefore to work-around this issue we temporarily disable
#     the app-bundle feature, just for this CMake module:
if(APPLE)
    #  Save the old setting
    SET(TEMP_DOXYGEN_SAVE_CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE ${CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE})
    # Disable the App-bundle detection feature
    SET(CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE "NEVER")
endif()
#     FYI:
#     In the older versions of OS X Doxygen, dot was included with the 
#     Doxygen bundle. But the new versions require you to download
#     Graphviz.app which contains "dot" in it's bundle.
# ============== End OSX stuff ================
