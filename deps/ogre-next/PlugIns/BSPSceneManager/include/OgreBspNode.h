    /** Encapsulates a node in a BSP tree.
        A BSP tree represents space partitioned by planes . The space which is
        partitioned is either the world (in the case of the root node) or the space derived
        from their parent node. Each node can have elements which are in front or behind it, which are
        it's children and these elements can either be further subdivided by planes,
        or they can be undivided spaces or 'leaf nodes' - these are the nodes which actually contain
        objects and world geometry.The leaves of the tree are the stopping point of any tree walking algorithm,
        both for rendering and collision detection etc.
        Ogre chooses not to represent splitting nodes and leaves as separate structures, but to merge the two for simplicity
        of the walking algorithm. If a node is a leaf, the isLeaf() method returns true and both getFront() and
        getBack() return null pointers. If the node is a partitioning plane isLeaf() returns false and getFront()
        and getBack() will return the corresponding BspNode objects.

            A BspNode can either be a splitting plane (the typical representation of a BSP node) or an undivided
            region contining geometry (a leaf node). Ogre represents both using the same class for simplicity
            of tree walking. However it is important that you use this method to determine which type you are dealing
            with, since certain methods are only supported with one of the subtypes. Details are given in the individual methods.
            Note that I could have represented splitting / leaf nodes as a class hierarchy but the
            virtual methods / run-time type identification would have a performance hit, and it would not make the
            code much (any?) simpler anyway. I think this is a fair trade-off in this case.

            each node had a list of pointers to other visible nodes, this would be very expensive in terms
            of storage (using the cluster method there is a table which is 1-bit squared per cluster, rounded
            up to the nearest byte obviously, which uses far less space than 4-bytes per linked node per source
            node). Of course the limitation here is that you have to each leaf in turn to determine if it is visible
            rather than just following a list, but since this is only done once per frame this is not such a big
            overhead.

            group list itself is allocated by the BspLevel for all nodes, and each leaf node is given a section of it to
