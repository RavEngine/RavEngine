        This specialisation of SceneNode is to enable information about the
        leaf node in which any attached objects are held is stored for
        use in the visibility determination. 
    @par
        Do not confuse this class with BspNode, which reflects nodes in the
        BSP tree itself. This class is just like a regular SceneNode, except that
        it should be locating BspNode leaf elements which objects should be included
        in. Note that because objects are movable, and thus may very well be overlapping
        the boundaries of more than one leaf, that it is possible that an object attached
        to one BspSceneNode may actually be associated with more than one BspNode.
