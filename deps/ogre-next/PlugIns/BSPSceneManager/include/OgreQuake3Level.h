    /** Support for loading and extracting data from a Quake3 level file.
    This class implements the required methods for opening Quake3 level files
    and extracting the pertinent data within. Ogre supports BSP based levels
    through it's own BspLevel class, which is not specific to any file format,
    so this class is here to source that data from the Quake3 format.
    Quake3 levels include far more than just data for rendering - typically the
    <strong>leaves</strong> of the tree are used for rendering, and <strong>brushes,</strong>
    are used to define convex hulls made of planes for collision detection. There are also
    <strong>entities</strong> which define non-visual elements like player start
    points, triggers etc and <strong>models</strong> which are used for movable
    scenery like doors and platforms. <strong>Shaders</strong> meanwhile are textures
    with extra effects and 'content flags' indicating special properties like
    water or lava.
    I will try to support as much of this as I can in Ogre, but I won't duplicate
    the structure or necessarily use the same terminology. Quake3 is designed for a very specific
    purpose and code structure, whereas Ogre is designed to be more flexible,
    so for example I'm likely to separate game-related properties like surface flags
    from the generics of materials in my implementation.
    This is a utility class only - a single call to loadFromChunk should be
    enough. You should not expect the state of this object to be consistent
    between calls, since it uses pointers to memory which may no longer
    be valid after the original call. This is why it has no accessor methods
    for reading it's internal state.

            places they typically manipulate them as a chunk of data, rather than
            a file pointer since this is unsupported through compressed archives.
            Quake3 files are made up of a header (which contains version info and
            a table of the contents) and 17 'lumps' i.e. sections of data,
            the offsets to which are kept in the table of contents. The 17 types
            are predefined (You can find them in OgreQuake3Types.h)
