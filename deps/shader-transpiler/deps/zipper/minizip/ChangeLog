      data need to be removed.

    - Defined ZPOS64_T to fpos_t on windows and u_int64_t on linux.

      More if/def section may be needed to support other platforms
    - Defined fxxxx64 calls to normal fopen/ftell/fseek so they would compile on windows.
     (but you should use iowin32.c for windows instead)
