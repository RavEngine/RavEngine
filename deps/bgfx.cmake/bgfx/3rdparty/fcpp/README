Frexx CPP (C Preprocessor)

Copyright (c) by Daniel Stenberg 1993 - 2011

This is a C preprocessor. It is a project based on public domain code, then
forked by Daniel in 1993 and future work has been done under a BSD license.

The C preprocessor is now (mostly?) ANSI C compliant, and some tweaks have
been applied to also make it fairly usable to process other data files, such
as HTML for simple web sites.
