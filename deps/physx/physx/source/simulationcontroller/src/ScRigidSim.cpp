	PT:

	The BP group ID comes from a Cm::IDPool, and RigidSim is the only class releasing the ID.

	The rigid tracker ID comes from a Cm::IDPool internal to an ObjectIDTracker, and RigidSim
	is the only class using it.

	Thus we should:
	- promote the BP group ID stuff to a "tracker" object
	- use the BP group ID as a rigid ID
