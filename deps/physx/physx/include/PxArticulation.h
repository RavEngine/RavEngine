\brief a tree structure of bodies connected by joints that is treated as a unit by the dynamics solver

Articulations are more expensive to simulate than the equivalent collection of
PxRigidDynamic and PxJoint structures, but because the dynamics solver treats
each articulation as a single object, they are much less prone to separation and
have better support for actuation. An articulation may have at most 64 links.
