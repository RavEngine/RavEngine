	\param[in] maxTouchHits	Maximum number of hits to record in the touch buffer for this query. Default=0 reports a single blocking hit. If maxTouchHits is set to 0 all hits are treated as blocking by default.
	\param[in] hitFlags		Specifies which properties per hit should be computed and returned in hit array and blocking hit.
	\param[in] filterData	Filtering data passed to the filter shader. See #PxQueryFilterData #PxBatchQueryPreFilterShader, #PxBatchQueryPostFilterShader
	\param[in] userData		User can pass any value in this argument, usually to identify this particular query
	\param[in] cache		Cached hit shape (optional). Query is tested against cached shape first. If no hit is found the ray gets queried against the scene.
							Note: Filtering is not executed for a cached shape if supplied; instead, if a hit is found, it is assumed to be a blocking hit.
							Note: Using past touching hits as cache will produce incorrect behavior since the cached hit will always be treated as blocking.

	\param[in] geometry		Geometry of object to check for overlap (supported types are: box, sphere, capsule, convex).
	\param[in] pose			Pose of the object.
	\param[in] maxTouchHits	Maximum number of hits to record in the touch buffer for this query. Default=0 reports a single blocking hit. If maxTouchHits is set to 0 all hits are treated as blocking by default.
