/**
\brief PxDirectGPUAPI exposes an API that enables batched direct access to GPU data for a PxScene.

The functions in this class allow batched direct access to GPU data for PxRigidDynamic, PxArticulationReducedCoordinate, 
PxShape and PxD6Joint types. This allows interoperation with GPU post- and preprocessing for users and allows the user 
to implement more efficient CPU-GPU data copies based on the specific needs of the application.

Using this direct-API will disable the existing CPU-based API for all the data exposed in the direct-API. For any API function
that does not have a counterpart in this direct-API, the existing API will continue to work.

To use this API, PxSceneFlag::eENABLE_DIRECT_GPU_API needs to be raised, in combination with PxSceneFlag::eENABLE_GPU_DYNAMICS
and PxBroadphaseType::eGPU. Note that these options are immutable and cannot be changed after the scene has been created.

Due to the internal architecture of the GPU-accelerated parts of PhysX, using this API comes with caveats:

1) All GPU-CPU copies for data exposed in this API will be disabled. This means that the existing CPU-based API will 
return outdated data, and any setters for data exposed in the interface will not work. On the other hand, significant
speedups can be achieved because of the reduced amount of GPU-CPU memory copies.

2) Due to the internal architecture of the GPU-accelerated PhysX, this API will only work after a first simulation step has been
taken. The reason for this is that the PxScene first needs to know all the actors it will have to simulate, and setup the 
sizes of the GPU-based structures. For setup, the existing CPU API should be used.

\note Due to the fact that this API is exposing low-level data, we do reserve the right to change this API without deprecation
in case of changes in the internal implementations.

	\brief Evaluate sample point distances and gradients on SDF shapes in local space. Local space is the space in which the mesh's raw vertex positions are represented.
	\param[out] localGradientAndSignedDistanceConcatenated User-provided GPU buffer where the evaluated gradients and distances in SDF local space get stored. It has the same structure as localSamplePointsConcatenated. The PxVec4 elements contain the gradient and the distance (gradX, gradY, gradZ, distance).
	\param[in] shapeIndices User-provided GPU index buffer containing elements of PxShapeGPUIndex. This buffer contains the GPU indices of the PxShape objects that are part of this operation. See #PxShape::getGPUIndex(). The size of this buffer (in bytes) needs to be nbElements * sizeof(PxShapeGPUIndex). The shapes must be triangle mesh shapes with SDFs.
	\param[in] localSamplePointsConcatenated User-provided GPU buffer containing the sample point locations for every shape in the shapes' local space. The buffer stride is maxPointCount.
	\param[in] samplePointCountPerShape User-provided GPU buffer containing the number of sample points for every shape.
	\param[in] nbElements The number of shapes to be queried.
	\param[in] maxPointCount The maximum value in the array samplePointCountPerShape. Note that the arrays localGradientAndSignedDistanceConcatenated and localSamplePointsConcatenated must have the size (in bytes) nbElements * maxPointCount * sizeof(PxVec4).
	\param[in] startEvent User-provided CUDA event that is awaited at the start of this function. Defaults to NULL which means the function will dispatch the computation immediately.
	\param[in] finishEvent User-provided CUDA event that is recorded at the end of this function. Defaults to NULL which means the function will wait for the computation to finish before returning.

	Example: Ten shapes are part of the simulation. Three of them have an SDF (shapeIndices of the SDF meshes are 2, 4 and 6). For the first shape, the SDF distance of 10 sample points should be queried. 20 sample 
	points for the second mesh and 30 sample points for the third mesh. The slice size (=maxPointCount) is the maximum of sample points required for any shape participating in the query, 30 = max(10, 20, 30) for this example.
	The buffers required for the method evaluateSDFDistances are constructed as follows (not including optional parameters):
		* localGradientAndSignedDistanceConcatenated[length: 3 * 30]: 
			* No initialization needed. It will hold the result after the finishEvent occurred. It has the same structure as localSamplePointsConcatenated, see below.
			* The format of the written PxVec4 is as follows (gradX, gradY, gradZ, sdfDistance)
		* shapeIndices[length: 3]
			* The content is {2, 4, 6} which are the shape indices for this example
		* localSamplePointsConcatenated[length: 3 * 30]:			
			* Slice 0...29 has only the first 10 elements set to local sample points (w component is unused) with respect to the coordinate frame of the first shape to be queried
			* Slice 30...59 has only the first 20 elements set to local sample points (w component is unused) with respect to the coordinate frame of the second shape to be queried
			* Slice 60...89 has all 30 elements set to local sample points (w component is unused) with respect to the coordinate frame of the third shape to be queried
		* samplePointCountPerShape[length: 3]
			* The content is {10, 20, 30} which are the number of samples to evaluate per shape used in this example. Note that the slice size (=maxPointCount) is the maximum value in this list.
		* nbElements: 3 for this example since 3 shapes are participating in the query
		* maxPointCount: 30 for this example since 30 is the slice size (= maxPointCount = 30 = max(10, 20, 30))

	\return bool Whether the operation was successful. Note that this might not include asynchronous CUDA errors.
